User Onboarding Submit 

# Context
- Before, we've implemented get all questions for user. User will select and submit the answer
- Based on the answer, we will decide user into type (persona)

# Task
- You will read the mock data in frontend/src/app/persona/page.tsx
- Then design the table the need to store the data
- Implement POST API for allowing user submit
- Return persona of user (budget, duration, ...) (it should based on the frontend mock data above)

# Database
- You MUST use Postgres

# Logic
- Handle basic return logic. The actual logic will use AI for analyzing but we don't implement it in this shot

# Unit test
- You don't need to write unit test
